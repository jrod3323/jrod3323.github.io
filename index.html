                      <h5 class="card-title">About Me</h5>
                      <p class="card-text overflow-auto">I have been in the transplant industry since 2011. My career started at Indiana Donor Network (IDN) in 2011 as an Organ 
                        Procurement Coordinator. During my time at IDN, I managed all aspects of the organ procurement process. I also served on 
                        several committees and worked closely with the clinical manager to develop antibiotic and lung therapy protocols. In 2013 
                        I accepted a position with Buckeye Transplant Services (BTS) as an import coordinator where I closely work with transplant 
                        centers to evaluate organs and help facilitate the organ transplant process. As the company has grown, I have grown with it. 
                        I was promoted in 2015 to a Lead Coordinator, from there I was promoted to Clinical Support Manager. 
                        Buckeye Transplant is a unique company in healthcare and has given me a unique opportunity to learn many aspects of growing a 
                        company. After my time as a Clinical Support Manager, I transitioned into a HR Compliance Manager role where I helped Buckeye 
                        with the employee onboarding process and helped ensure compliance with all labor laws across all 50 states. While wearing many 
                        hats at Buckeye Transplant I became interested in how technology could help streamline and standardize our many processes. To 
                        help Buckeye Transplant grow, I transitioned into an IT Project Manager role to develop tools and applications to streamline 
                        and standardized our processes company wide. I am a highly motivated employee skilled in Customer Service, Interpersonal 
                        Skills, Management, Process Management, and Healthcare. </p>

                      <p class="my-2">COVID has made it difficult to plan activities and excursions for those who choose to travel domestically within the US. Travelers don’t always have updated information about COVID prevalence, nor can they predict which activities are available to partake in while traveling to the state of their choice. Our website, does both of these things. If a user decides to choose Colorado, for example, our COVID Travel Planner will present the most up to date COVID data for that state, and then will suggest national parks in which we believe domestic travelers can feel safe outdoors while following suggested CDC guidelines for traveling during the pandemic. </p>

                      <p class="my-2">This project is a Daily Planner. The tool is designed to provide the user with a means of scheduling their day.

                        On the table, hours that have already past will be shown as grey.  The current active hour is shown as red, and future hours are populated as green.
                        
                        A user will input their plans for each hour in the text area provided.  After inputting the data, they will click save to save the data to local storage.  This allows data to persist on reload of the page.  
                        
                        At the end of the day or beginning of a new day, the user can click the Clear Schedule button at the bottom to clear the Scheduler.
                        
                        Of note, the scheduler will auto update the time every 60 seconds and it will also refresh the Scheduler every 60 seconds to ensure that each hour row is populated with the correct color if the scheduler is left open.</p>

                        A user will use the search fields in the aside to search for a City based on that Cities Name and Full State name.  
                        
                        In the main data area, there is a jumbotron showing the searched for City and State as well as the date.  The current weather icon, temperature, wind speed and UV index will also be displayed.  The UV index will also be color coded based on a low, medium, or high index value.  
                        
                        Below the main data area, the user will see a 5 day forecast for the given City that shows the date, weather icon, temperature and humidity for those days.  
                        
                        Also, in the aside, there will be a list of most recent city searches.  This will populate up to 10 of the most recent searches from local storage.  If the user clicks one of these recent searches, the weather info for the City will be displayed. 
                        
                        Also of note, on open, the user will be prompted with their most recent search.  If there are no recent searches in local storage, the user will see a jumbotron with the message " Please Choose A City To Display ".</p>
