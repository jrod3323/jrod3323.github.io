                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I have been in the transplant industry since 2011. My career started at Indiana Donor Network (IDN) in 2011 as an Organ 
                    Procurement Coordinator. During my time at IDN, I managed all aspects of the organ procurement process. I also served on 
                    several committees and worked closely with the clinical manager to develop antibiotic and lung therapy protocols. In 2013 
                    I accepted a position with Buckeye Transplant Services (BTS) as an import coordinator where I closely work with transplant 
                    centers to evaluate organs and help facilitate the organ transplant process. As the company has grown, I have grown with it. 
                    I was promoted in 2015 to a Lead Coordinator, from there I was promoted to Clinical Support Manager. 
                    Buckeye Transplant is a unique company in healthcare and has given me a unique opportunity to learn many aspects of growing a 
                    company. After my time as a Clinical Support Manager, I transitioned into a HR Compliance Manager role where I helped Buckeye 
                    with the employee onboarding process and helped ensure compliance with all labor laws across all 50 states. While wearing many 
                    hats at Buckeye Transplant I became interested in how technology could help streamline and standardize our many processes. To 
                    help Buckeye Transplant grow, I transitioned into an IT Project Manager role to develop tools and applications to streamline 
                    and standardized our processes company wide. I am a highly motivated employee skilled in Customer Service, Interpersonal 
                    Skills, Management, Process Management, and Healthcare.
